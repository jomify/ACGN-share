# ACGN-share

ACGN Share is a simple website for sharing open source games and related documents.

## Structure

- `site/index.html` – Home page
- `site/games.html` – Game list (data loaded from `games.json`)
- `site/docs.html` – Resource links (data loaded from `docs.json`)
- `site/style.css` – Basic styles
- `site/scripts.js` – JavaScript for loading data
- `site/games.json` – Example game data
- `site/docs.json` – Example document links

## Usage

Open `site/index.html` in your browser or host the contents of the `site` directory on any static file server. Edit the JSON files to add your own games and documents; the pages will update automatically.
